# Libft

Welcome to Libft, a starter project from the 42 course designed to help you hone your programming skills. This project requires you to recode a set of functions from the standard C library, as well as develop some other useful utility functions. With Libft, you'll get hands-on experience with string manipulation, memory management, and linked lists, which are essential tools for building more complex projects. So dive in, explore the code, and get in touch if you have any doubt!
